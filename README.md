This project serves as a template for implementing Redux in a React Native app as well as configuring Scenes/Routes. It's pretty well structured to serve as a foundation for any app.

This app is based upon an example from Stephen Griders course on React and Redux meant for Web Apps that I ported over to React Native. He has amazing courses on React and Redux as well as React Native. Link Below.

[Modern React and Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

Tools that were used some differ from the course.
* react-redux
* react-native-router-flux
* t-comb-form-native
